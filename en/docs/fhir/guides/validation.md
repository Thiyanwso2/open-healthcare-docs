# Validation

 FHIR validation involves checking FHIR resources against defined profiles, extensions, and structure definitions to ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and compliant with the expected formats and standards. It is a crucial process in ensuring that healthcare data adheres to the FHIR standard's rules and constraints. FHIR validation helps to identify errors, enforce data integrity, and maintain interoperability across different healthcare systems. By validating FHIR resources, organizations can ensure that their data meets the required specifications, ultimately improving the quality and reliability of healthcare information exchange.
